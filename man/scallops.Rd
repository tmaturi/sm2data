\description{
Scallops are small bivalves that live in deep waters and grow in shells, much the way oysters do. The data set consists of 127 locations (represented by two variables, longitude  and latitude) at which scallops were collected in a 1990 survey cruise in the Atlantic continental shelf off Long Island, New York, USA.
